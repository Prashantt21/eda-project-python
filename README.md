Exploratory Data Analysis on a housing dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

🏡 Exploratory Data Analysis on Housing Dataset
This project showcases Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a housing dataset using Python. The analysis involves understanding the structure, summary, and patterns within the data, visualizing relationships, and identifying potential outliers or anomalies that can inform future modeling or decision-making.

📌 Key Objectives
Explore the data types, distributions, and summary statistics

Identify missing values and treat them accordingly

Analyze numerical and categorical variables

Visualize correlations and patterns between features

Gain actionable insights from raw data

📊 Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

📈 Key Analyses Performed
Univariate Analysis (Histograms, Value Counts)

Bivariate Analysis (Boxplots, Pairplots, Correlation Heatmaps)

Outlier Detection

Feature Understanding (impact on price or target variable)

💡 Insights
(Replace these with specific insights you derived from the analysis)

Feature X has a strong positive correlation with Price

There are several outliers in LotArea that may affect predictions

Missing values in PoolQC and Alley suggest they’re mostly unused or can be encoded as “None”

🚀 How to Run This Notebook
1. Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eda-housing-data-analysis.git
  cd eda-housing-data-analysis

3. Launch the notebook
  jupyter notebook EDA_Housing_Data.ipynb

✅ Project Status
Completed ✅ – Ready for review, learning reference, or to serve as a base for predictive modeling.
